# 🎵 Chord Recognition using Machine Learning  

A machine learning-based project to recognize **musical chords** from audio input. The goal is to bridge music and AI by building a system that can automatically classify chords, enabling applications in **music education, transcription, and real-time analysis**.

## 🚀 Features  
- 🎶 **Audio Processing**: Extracts relevant features (MFCCs, chroma features, spectral features) from audio.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Trained classifiers to detect and label chords.  
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- 🖥️ **Interactive Workflow**: Modular code structure for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  
- 🎸 **Potential Applications**: Music learning apps, auto-transcription tools, live performance analysis.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:  
  - [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) – Audio processing  
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – Data handling  
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) – ML models  
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – Visualization

## 📊 Dataset  
- Publicly available **guitar/piano chord datasets** or custom-recorded samples.  
- Preprocessing includes trimming, normalization, and feature extraction.  
- Features considered:  
  - **Chroma vectors** (captures harmonic content)  
  - **MFCCs** (captures timbre)  
  - **Spectral centroid, roll-off, bandwidth**  

---

## 🔑 How It Works  
1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Load audio files.  
   - Extract chroma & MFCC features.  
   - Normalize and create feature vectors.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Split dataset into train/test.  
   - Train classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network).  

3. **Prediction**  
   - Input an audio clip.  
   - Extract features and pass through trained model.  
   - Output predicted chord (e.g., *C major*, *G minor*).  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Achieved ~`XX%` accuracy on test set (replace with actual).  
- Confusion matrix shows model performs best on **major chords**, struggles slightly with **minor 7ths**.  
- Visualizations included in `/results`.
